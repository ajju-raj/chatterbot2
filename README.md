# Real-time Chatbot with OpenAI API using Next.js

This repository contains a small project that demonstrates how to create a real-time chatbot using the OpenAI API. The project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Features

- Real-time communication with the OpenAI API to generate responses
- Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and efficient API routes
- Deployed using Vercel for seamless, scalable deployment
- Simple, clean UI for interacting with the chatbot

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI API**: Powers the chatbot's responses
- **Next.js**: Framework for building the web app
- **Vercel**: Platform for deployment

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (you can sign up for an API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 4. Running the Application Locally

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Deploying on Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project.
3. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
4. In the Vercel dashboard, add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable.
5. Deploy the project, and Vercel will automatically build and deploy your Next.js app.
